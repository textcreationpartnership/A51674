    _ ILLUSTRATIONS UPON THE TREATISE Concerning the SEARCH after TRUTH.

      * THE FIRST ILLUSTRATION UPON THE First CHAPTER of the First BOOK. God works whatever is real in the Motions of the Mind, and in the Determinations of them; notwithstanding which, he is not the Author of Sin. He works whatever is real in the Sensations of Concupiscence, and yet is not the Author of it.

God works whatever is real in the Sensations of Concupiscence, and yet is not the Author of Concupiscence.

      * THE SECOND ILLUSTRATION UPON THE First CHAPTER of the First BOOK; Where I say, That the Will cannot diversly determine its Propensity to Good, but by commanding the Vnderstanding to represent to it some particular Object.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Third CHAPTER of the First BOOK; Where I say, That Mysteries of Faith being of a Supernatural Order, we need not wonder if we want the Evidence, since we want the Ideas of them.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION On these Words of the Fifth CHAPTER of the First BOOK, This being the Case, it ought to be concluded that Adam was not invited to the Love of God, and the rest of his Duty, by a preventing Pleasure; forasmuch as the Knowledge which he had of God, as of his Good, and the Joy he was continually possess'd with, necessarily consequent to the View of his Felicity in his uniting himself with God, were sufficient Motives to recommend his Duty to him, and to make his Actions more meritorious than if he had been, as it were, determin'd by a preventing Pleasure.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Fifth CHAPTER of the First BOOK; Where I say, That Preventing Delight is the Grace of JESUS CHRIST.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION Upon what I have said at the Beginning of the Tenth CHAPTER of the First BOOK, And in the Sixth CHAPTER of the Second BOOK, CONCERNING METHOD: That 'tis very difficult to prove the Existence of Bodies: What we ought to Esteem of the Proofs which are brought of their Existence.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Fifth CHAPTER of the Second BOOK. Of the Memory, and Spiritual Habits.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Seventh CHAPTER of the Second BOOK. A Reduction of the Proofs and Explications I have given of Original Sin: Together with the Answer to the Objections, that I thought most urgent.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Third CHAPTER of the Third PART of the Second BOOK. Wherein I speak of the power of Imagination of some Authors, and particularly of Tertullian.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Nature of IDEAS. Wherein I explain how we see all things in God, both Truths and Laws Eternal.

Against what has been said, that none but God enlightens us, and that we see all things in him. OBJECTION I.

OBJECTION II.

OBJECTION III.

OBJECTION.

OBJECTION.

OBJECTION.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Seventh CHAPTER of the Second PART of the Third BOOK. Where I prove, That we have no clear Idea of the Nature, or Modifications of our Soul.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Eighth CHAPTER of the Second PART of the Third BOOK. Of loose and general terms which signify nothing. How they are distinguish'd from others.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Conclusion of the Three First BOOKS. That Physicians and Casuists are absolutely necessary for us; But that it is dangerous to consult and follow them in many occasions.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Third CHAPTER of the Fifth BOOK. That Love is different from Pleasure and Joy.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON THE Third CHAPTER of the Second PART of the Sixth BOOK. Concerning the Efficacy ascribed to Second Causes.

ARGUMENT I.

ARGUMENT II.

ARGUMENT III.

ARGUMENT IV.

ARGUMENT V.

ARGUMENT VI.

ARGUMENT VII.

      * THE ILLUSTRATION UPON WHAT I have said in the Fourth Chapter of the Second Part, concerning Method, and elsewhere. That God Acts always with Order, and by the simplest ways.

    _ THE DEFENCE OF THE AUTHOR OF THE TREATISE Concerning the Search after Truth, Against the Accusation of Monsieur de la VILLE.

      * ARGUMENT I.

The first Consequence opposite to Faith. That God is Vnjust.

The second Consequence contrary to Faith. That God Wills Disorder, and that Nature is not corrupted.

The third Consequence contrary to Faith. The Soul of Man is Mortal, or at least the Souls of Beasts pass from one Body to another.

      * ARGUMENT II.

A Consequence opposite to the first Principle of Morality, which obliges us to love God with all our Strength, and to fear none but Him.

      * ARGUMENT III. The Consequence of the Principle propos'd by Monsieur de la Ville, as a Point of Faith, viz. That the Essence of Body consists not in Extension. This negative Principle overthrows the only demonstrative and direct Proof we have of the Soul's being a distinct Substance from the Body, and consequently of her Immortality.
